# EAS-Inspector-For-Fiddler
This is an inspector add-in for Fiddler and is used in Fiddler to convert the binary content of Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) payloads from binary data (EAS WBXML) into non-bianary XML.

This application does not collect or transfer any data.  It only does a data conversion content Fidler is rendering if it is of EAS content.
