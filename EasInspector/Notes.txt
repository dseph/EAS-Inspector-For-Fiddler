EASInspector

This is an inspector which can be used with Fiddler.  

To compile:
	Install Fiddler 2.4.4.5 or later.

	Check the Post-event command line settings on the Build Events tab of the project's 
	properties to be sure that the paths map to the Inspector folder of fiddler.

	Run Visual Studio 2010 with Admin privlidges. This is needed for the copying of the
	application DDL to Fiddler's Inspector folder.

	Check and set the reference to Fiddler to match the path to the Fiddler.exe 
	installed on your system.

When this is run you should see an "EAS XML" tab listed in Fiddler.  When ActiveSync content is 
being viewed you should see the decoded content in the inspector.

 
Most of the code comes from the Exchange Server Interoperability Guidance samples for Activesync, in particular:

This code is not supported by anyone and exists purely for educational purposes.  If you are building an ActiveSync 
application which is going to be commercialized then you really need to look into licensing.

History:

7/5/2013
Got code to work. 
Initial check-in.

1.0 Release

7/11/2013
The content type header is used to determine if EAS decoding should be done.  I had it too specific 
so that it only decoded application/vnd.ms-sync.wbxml content.  It will now decode anything with a 
content type starting with application/vnd.ms-sync
