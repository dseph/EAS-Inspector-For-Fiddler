EASInspector:
--------------------

Published: https://github.com/dseph/EAS-Inspector-For-Fiddler

This is an inspector add-in for Fiddler and is used in Fiddler to convert the binary content of 
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) payloads from binary data (EAS WBXML) into non-bianary XML.

This application does not collect or transfer any data.  It only does a data conversion content 
Fidler is rendering if it is of EAS content.

The following EAS versions are implmented: 12.0 12.1 12.1, 14.0, 14.1, 16.0, 16.1.  However, older 
versions may work.

--------------------
To compile:
--------------------

	.Net 4.6.1 needs to be installed. Adjust this to what Fiddler uses if needed. you can see the
	version of .Net Fiddler uses on its Help -> About window.

	Install Fiddler 2.4.4.5 or later.

	Check the Post-event command line settings on the Build Events tab of the project's 
	properties to be sure that the paths map to the Inspector folder of fiddler.

	Run Visual Studio with Admin privlidges. This is needed for the copying of the
	application DDL to Fiddler's Inspector folder.

	Check and set the reference to Fiddler to match the path to the Fiddler.exe 
	installed on your system.

--------------------
To install:
--------------------

Build the appliction and copy the EASInspectorFiddler.dll to the Inspector's folder of Fiddler.

Example:

	C:\Users\contosouser\AppData\Local\Programs\Fiddler\Inspectors\

--------------------
To use:
--------------------

After intalling the EASInspectorFiddler.dll just start Fiddler and either trace or load a Fiddler trace file.

Select a line/frame of ActiveSync (EAS) traffic.  On the right is a horisontally split window which shows requests at the top
and responses starting in the middle.  You should see an "EAS XML" tab listed in each of these sections. Click on 
the "EAS XML" tabs of these sections".  When ActiveSync content is being viewed you should see the decoded content in those tabs.

7/5/2013
Got code to work. 
Initial check-in.

1.0 Release

7/11/2013
The content type header is used to determine if EAS decoding should be done.  I had it too specific 
so that it only decoded application/vnd.ms-sync.wbxml content.  It will now decode anything with a 
content type starting with application/vnd.ms-sync
 
1.1 Released.

5/16/2014
+ Autoselection of inspector when hitting enter or double-clicking a session
+ Updated error handling
+ Basic help tips system added
+ Auto-decoding of GZIP and chunked sessions

1.2 Released  5/16/2014

10/29/2014
+ Added "Smart" view, parsing some basic quoted-printable content and displaying the XML in an invalid, but easier to read format.
