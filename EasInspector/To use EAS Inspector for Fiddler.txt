EAS Inspector for Fiddler version 1.5.0.0. This includes the code supporting EAS 12.0 through 16.1.

To use:
    Copy the EASInspectorFiddler.dll to the Inspector's folder of Fiddler.

Example:

    C:\Users\contosouser\AppData\Local\Programs\Fiddler\Inspectors\

    Note: that above "contosouser" is the profile name of the user who will be running Fiddler.  Change for the user using this inspector.

After installing the EASInspectorFiddler.dll just start Fiddler and either trace or load a Fiddler trace file.
Select a line/frame of ActiveSync (EAS) traffic. On the right is a horizontally split window which shows requests at the top
and responses starting in the middle. You should see an "EAS XML" tab listed in each of these sections. Click on
the "EAS XML" tabs of these sections". When ActiveSync content is being viewed you should see the decoded content in those tabs.
